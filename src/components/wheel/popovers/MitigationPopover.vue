            Triaging with a targeted history and symptoms, as well as conducting a differential diagnosis can allow
            prophylactic measures to be put in place to limit ocular surface damage.

            Other ocular surface conditions can serve as a trigger for the vicious circle of dry eye disease and lead to
            discomfort symptoms for patients. Reduce this risk by carefully identifying risk factors such as contact
            lens wear, digital device use, environmental challenges, and hormonal and medicine changes, as well as
            assessing the eyes for incidental findings, and manage or refer the patient accordingly.
