        Heat can be applied externally to the eyelids with the aid of a wide range of warm compresses, which may contain
        microwave-heated seeds or glass beads, or by latent moist heat application delivered via goggles. Heat helps to
        unblock the meibomian glands and plays an important role in the management of meibomian gland dysfunction, which
        is the major factor leading to evaporative dry eye.
