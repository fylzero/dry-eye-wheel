            Management of dry eye requires a staged approach, with more severe conditions often requiring multiple
            treatments.

            However, the majority of patients can be managed with relatively simple strategies, comprising ocular
            lubricants and lid hygiene measures.

            Management strategies should be ideally aimed at managing the severity of the disease, in addition to being
            targeted towards the major underlying reason for the dry eye. Sub-typing of the disease into whether it is
            aqueous-deficient, evaporative, or mixed in nature, can assist with the choice of treatment.
